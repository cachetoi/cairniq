"""The weekly one-page review â€” Advisor Roadmap product surface.

One page, once a week, assembled from surfaces that already exist: the wealth
goal as the headline, the week's market state, how past advice actually scored,
what the advisor said in the last seven days, whether the background engines are
alive, and which user-authored inputs are still blank.

**Why this, after four builds nobody could see.** 1.8's grading, 3.9's deployment
ladder, 2.3's provenance and 6.2's substitution counts are all correct, all
shipped, and all invisible on a healthy box â€” each one exists as a number in a
JSON file that nothing reads on a schedule. This page is where those numbers
become something a person reads. It adds no new intelligence on purpose; it is a
READ surface over intelligence that already shipped.

THE CONTRACT, and it is the whole reason this module is written the way it is:

1. **Every section always renders.** A section with nothing to say says so, by
   name, and is never omitted. This is not a style preference â€” a report is the
   highest-risk possible surface for the 2026-07-21 failure, where
   truthiness-gated blocks emitted nothing, the reader expected a full page, and
   the silence got back-filled with real-sounding content. An explicit "nothing
   this week" cannot be back-filled. ``tests/test_tools/test_weekly_review.py``
   renders against a completely empty profile and asserts every section is still
   present.
2. **It never generates, only reads.** The market pulse is read from cache and
   never kicked off; no LLM, no scan, no network beyond what a cached read
   implies. A report that triggers work is a report that can time out, cost
   money, or â€” worst â€” quietly change the state it is describing.
3. **It never invents a number.** Absent is absent. Where a real figure cannot
   be computed the section says why, in the same spirit as
   ``goal_projection.realized_return_status``.

Three rules carried over from ``tools.profile_readiness``, which this module is
modelled on and which learned all three the hard way:

  - **Read through the accessor the consumer reads through** â€” never straight
    out of the JSON. A surface that re-derives a figure can disagree with the
    engine it is describing, and then it lies in the direction that hurts.
  - **Count the thing the CONSUMER reads.** For advice scoring that means
    DISTINCT CALLS, never ledger rows: on the live ledger 9 graded rows were 4
    calls, and a row count would have reported a sample more than twice its
    true size.
  - **Prose names capabilities, not code.** Roadmap numbers, endpoints and
    function names live in the ``roadmap`` field and in these docstrings, never
    in a line the reader sees.
